Before you start evaluating the code I just want to tell a story of my current situation. 
.
In 16th february 2022 I became a father of a beautiful baby girl. 
at the same time I had to Relese the ride sharing app that week that I have been working on for last 8 months now. 
since then I haven’t been able to manage a long strach of time after work for pretty much anything other then making arrangements for the new baby. 
I really admire the diversity and work ethic of anymind group. 
that's why I tried to complete as much as the main requirements. 
but unfortunately due to time constraints I could not finish all the requirements but I believe I demonstrated enough to show some of my abilities. 
I hope you will review the code with kind heart and give me a fair chance. 



Best, 
Mehedi
