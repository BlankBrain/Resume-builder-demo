# Resume-builder-demo
Take home project for anymind group
.
.
Before you start evaluating the code I just want to tell a story of my current situation. 
.
In 16th february 2022 I became a father of a beautiful baby girl. 
at the same time I had to Relese the ride sharing app that week that I have been working on for last 8 months now. 
since then I havenâ€™t been able to manage a long strach of time after work for pretty much anything other then making arrangements for the new baby. 
I really admire the diversity and work ethic of anymind group. 
that's why I tried to complete as much as the main requirements. 
but unfortunately due to time constraints I could not finish all the requirements but I believe I demonstrated enough to show some of my abilities. 
I hope you will review the code with kind heart and give me a fair chance. 
...
What will work: 
* you can input all fields and save to coredata 
* you can review your resume 
* you can include picture in resume 
* you can export your resume as PDF 
* you can see saved resume from coredata ( prettily done due to time constrain) 
///
here is what I could not implement due to time constraints 
. there is no validation on any of the fields 
. Edit function for saved resume is not finished.
. exported Resume PDF format is not pretty 
. many more ui related compromises that i made to save time 

Best, 
Mehedi
